# Micro Spatial Data Infrastructure

this project allows a 2 minute deployiment of a modern spatial data infrastructure based on QGIS server, PostGis DB and Caddy webserver.

It comes with Docker-compose and Docker swarm examples. it listens by default to `https://localhost` and uses autogenerated certificates. 

If you want to publish it to a domain, you can modify the Caddyfile by changing `localhost` to your domain and by deleting the `local_certs` line

## Demo
The included demo project can be found at `https://localhost/ows/bees` it exposes WMS, WMTS and WFS.
